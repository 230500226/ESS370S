INSTRUCTIONS (to AGC, students, invigilators, etc) 

The student need access to Blackboard, which is a learning management system.  The student has to use physical devices that he/she has to connect to a computer.  The student then has to write the report.  After completing the investigative report the student have to upload to Blackboard. 

REQUIREMENTS(e.g 2 answer books, etc)

Graduate Attribute 4: Investigative Report 

 

 

 

The design and evaluation of a solar powered washing machine 

 

  Solar panels are becoming more popular for various reasons.  The electrical output power that the solar panels can provide varies.  You have to investigate how to develop a controller for a washing machine that can accommodate these changes in the availability of electrical power.  Thus, you have to investigate different types of washing machines.  Investigate the advantages and disadvantages of different types of washing machines.  Before you can design a controller for the washing machine, you need a washing machine which controller you can change.  You have to state which washing machine you consider the best for adapting to this purpose and why.  You also have to be able to explain the reasons the solar panels output varies with multiple household appliances connected to the solar panels.   

    Hardware  

  Use an Arduino as the controller of the washing machine.  Assume your controller is going to control and direct drive washing machine.  Determine the basic components of a direct drive washing machine.  You will need to determine which devices, which an Arduino commonly uses, can emulate the different components of a direct drive washing machine.   

Software  

  You will need to determine what the controller of a washing machine’s function is.   What I have done is to look at what a physical washing machine is doing at what time.  Determine three basic cycles of a washing machine.   

Responsibility 

 

  This is the first of two records that you have to submit.  The first document is the Graduate Attribute record.  The Graduate Attribute document is the record that needs to show your investigation into the project before you started.  The mark for this Graduate Attribute is T3 on MAS or OPA.  For the Graduate Attribute 4 submission, you have to do the following: 

    Download the template from Blackboard. 

    Replace all the green text in the template with your own statements.  Use what was written in green as an indication of what is required. 

    Look at Graduate Attribute 4’s rubric to make sure you have answered the indicators.  Marks will be provided according to Graduate Attribute 4’s rubric. 

    Add sketches where required. 

    Upload as a word or PDF document to Blackboard on the space provided here. 

Recommendations 

  Refrain from using the words “I”, “we”, “us”, “thing”, “done” and “working”.  Try to make your sentences as short as possible.  So, if a sentence can be broken into multiple sentences then break the sentence.  Shorter sentences are easier to read than longer sentences.  Read the following sentence out loud: After you have downloaded the template the guidelines in green has to be replaced because it contains just guidelines that will guide you to write the correct information and the instructions in green are not information that should be in your final documentation that you are going to upload which is different from the statements in black as the statements in black should be in the final document as it is the headings and information that is commonly found in documents like where the conclusion should be and where the introduction should be where the introduction should start with a statement that should be different from what the reader knows followed by the information that the documentation tries to achieve while the conclusion is the mirror image of the introduction where the conclusion ends with the result that was stated at the beginning of the introduction thus completing the whole document where some of the information in the template do not count for marks as indicated in the rubric of the Graduate Attribute provided to you at the end of the Study Guide where it will also mentions the number of marks dedicated to each indicator and the way the marker is going to use to mark this document after you have submitted it on Blackboard as indicated previously in this document.  

   Refrain from repeating phrases.  For example do not say:  “……and then…….and then…..and then….”    These recommendations you can use for any technical document that you are writing.
