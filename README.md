Introduction
• Aim. What is your motivation for undertaking the investigation?
• Clearly describe the technical area that your investigation is involved in.
• Be sure to delete all the GREEN ITALIC text that appear in this template in the final version of your
proposal.
1. Description of the Problem
Clearly and fully describe the engineering problem that you identified. Identify the problem the person
in the scenario described in the “Investigation Specification” has. Please show that this section is for
Graduate Attribute 4 Indicator 1.
2. Literature Review
Answer in your own words the following questions:
• Which three things influences the amount of power the solar panels have available when it’s
inverter is connected to multiple appliances?
• Which cycles does a washing machine go through?
• How much electrical power does a washing machine generate?
• Give an estimate of the average power for each cycle. Also, give the reason for each estimate.
• Draw a block diagram that shows all the basic components of a washing machine.
• Show that this section is for Graduate Attribute 4 Indicator 2.
3. Comparative analysis
For the washing machine, consider different water heating options. At the end, you have to indicate
which washing machine connections is the best for different scenarios. So, list different combinations
of power sources. Underneath each combination of power sources, give multiple different washing
machine connections options. Give the advantages and disadvantages of each of these machine
connections for each of the different combinations of power sources. You have to indicate why
something is an advantage and why it is not an advantage. So, start by determining the different
connections that can be made to a washing machine. Consider the following for each machine
connection:.
a Criteria
b Cost
c Technology
d Typology
Show that this section is for Graduate Attribute 4 Indicator 4.
4. Objectives of the Investigation
• Explain in detail how you plan to solve the engineering or technical problem.
• Describe in bullet point form how you plan to solve the problem that you identified.
5. Conceptual Design
• Present a conceptual idea of how your system solution would look like. This can be a block diagram,
flow chart, etc.
• Also describe the components, equipment and infrastructure necessary to complete your
investigation.
6. Methodology
• Present and describe the main logical steps you will adopt from the start to completion of your
investigation.
• Develop a methodology or theoretical framework to investigate a problem.
• You can use bullet points to list the steps you plan to follow.
• Show that this section is for Graduate Attribute 4 Indicator 3.
7. Investigation Deliverables
Describe what item or artefact you intend to deliver at the completion of your investigation.
8. Investigation Plan
• Present a schedule in the form of a Gannt Chart or similar tool the tasks and milestones necessary
to successfully complete your investigation.
• Each task should have an associated time period assigned. Some tasks are sequential, while others
are parallel and occur at the same time.
9. Investigation Budget
• What are the estimated costs associated with the completion and delivery of your investigation?
• List in a table the items, components, systems, personnel, etc. and their associated costs.
• Ideally a budget is presented in a table.
• A budget always contains monetary values that is calculated showing other values of a variety of
types.
• Also explain the importance and significance of each listed item.
10.Scope, Limitations and implication
• What will the device that you have developed not be able to do?
• What is the consequences of this limitation?
11.Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the results that you found in your comparative analysis, indicate what you will
choose to connect to the washing machine. Indicate why you say that.
Tell other people, which is doing similar research, what you recommend they do. This
recommendation can be something that is outside of the scope of this research.
Show that this section is for Graduate Attribute 4 Indicator 5.
12. References
• Provide a list of all the information sources that you consulted and used in compiling your
document.
• Use the Harvard referencing method to cite all information sources.
• Refer to the reference guideline on Blackboard.
• You may use the built-in MS Word feature for Referencing. (see the “References” tab in the drop-
down menu)
• You may also use the free referencing software tool, Mendeley. Search the web. Mendeley has a
CPUT template that you can use.
13. Appendices (optional)
• You may add additional information here such as your software code, the main page (only a single
page, not more than 1 page) of specialised IC’s that are planned to be used, etc.
• The information in your appendix should support your proposal document.
