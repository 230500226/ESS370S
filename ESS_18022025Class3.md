## 1. Morse Code
Use the PWM pins connected to an LED to say "hi" in Morse code. Note that the durations of the dots, dashes, and separating values are if one unit is 500ms.

```cpp
const int ledPin = 9; // PWM pin connected to LED
const int unit = 500; // 1 unit = 500ms

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void dot() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(unit);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(unit);
}

void dash() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(3 * unit);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(unit);
}

void letterSpace() {
  delay(2 * unit);
}

void wordSpace() {
  delay(4 * unit);
}

void loop() {
  // Morse code for "H"
  dot(); dot(); dot(); dot();
  letterSpace();
  
  // Morse code for "I"
  dot(); dot();
  wordSpace();
  
  // Repeat the message
}
```

## 2. LED Trail
Using 10 LEDs, sequentially light up one LED after the other with one LED trailing behind. Therefore, there must be 2 LEDs lit simultaneously at any given time. Use a potentiometer to control the speed.

```cpp
const int ledPins[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}; // Pins for 10 LEDs
const int potPin = A0; // Potentiometer pin

void setup() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    pinMode(ledPins[i], OUTPUT);
  }
}

void loop() {
  int speed = analogRead(potPin) / 4; // Read potentiometer and map to delay value

  for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
    digitalWrite(ledPins[i], HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ledPins[i + 1], HIGH);
    delay(speed);
    digitalWrite(ledPins[i], LOW);
  }
  digitalWrite(ledPins[9], LOW);
}
```

## 3. PWM LED Brightness Control
### Step 1
Use 5 PWM pins to light up all 5 LEDs.

```cpp
const int pwmPins[] = {3, 5, 6, 9, 10}; // PWM pins

void setup() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    pinMode(pwmPins[i], OUTPUT);
    analogWrite(pwmPins[i], 255); // Full brightness
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Empty loop
}
```

### Step 2
Dim all 5 of the LEDs from Step 1.

```cpp
void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    analogWrite(pwmPins[i], 128); // Dim to half brightness
  }
}
```

### Step 3
Use the 5 LEDs. Start with all of them off, then increase brightness to full, then immediately turn off after reaching full, then loop.

```cpp
void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    analogWrite(pwmPins[i], 0); // Start off
  }
  delay(500);

  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    analogWrite(pwmPins[i], 255); // Full brightness
  }
  delay(500);

  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    analogWrite(pwmPins[i], 0); // Turn off
  }
  delay(500);
}
```

### Step 4
Use the 5 LEDs. Start off, increase brightness to full, then decrease brightness to off, then loop.

```cpp
void loop() {
  for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
    }
    delay(10);
  }
  
  for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
    }
    delay(10);
  }
}
```

### Step 5
Use the 5 LEDs. Start off, LED 1 increases brightness to full then dims to off, then loop for LED n+1 until the last LED (LED 5), then start loop from LED 1 again.

```cpp
void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(10);
    }
    for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(10);
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 6
Step 5 but 5 times faster.

```cpp
void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(2); // 5 times faster
    }
    for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(2); // 5 times faster
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 7
Step 5 but sweep back and forth.

```cpp
void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(10);
    }
    for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(10);
    }
  }

  for (int i = 3; i >= 0; i--) {
    for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(10);
    }
    for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(10);
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 8
Step 7 but if the starts and end (LED 1 and LED 5) were flashing twice instead of once like LED 2, 3, 4, then make them only flash once.

```cpp
void loop() {
  // LED 1
  for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
    analogWrite(pwmPins[0], brightness);
    delay(10);
  }
  for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
    analogWrite(pwmPins[0], brightness);
    delay(10);
  }

  // Middle LEDs
  for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++) {
    for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(10);
    }
    for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(10);
    }
  }

  // LED 5
  for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
    analogWrite(pwmPins[4], brightness);
    delay(10);
  }
  for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
    analogWrite(pwmPins[4], brightness);
    delay(10);
  }

  // Sweep back
  for (int i = 3; i >= 1; i--) {
    for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(10);
    }
    for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
      analogWrite(pwmPins[i], brightness);
      delay(10);
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 9
Make sure the code is optimized (less lines of code to do the same as Step 8).

```cpp
void fadeLed(int ledIndex, int delayTime) {
  for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
    analogWrite(pwmPins[ledIndex], brightness);
    delay(delayTime);
  }
  for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
    analogWrite(pwmPins[ledIndex], brightness);
    delay(delayTime);
  }
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    fadeLed(i, 10);
  }
  for (int i = 3; i >= 1; i--) {
    fadeLed(i, 10);
  }
}
```

### Step 10
Using 2 LEDs on PWM pins. Fade LED 1 to the lowest brightness (not completely off) from full brightness while the other LED 2 is the opposite brightness (so LED 2 is full brightness when LED 1 is lowest brightness). Loop the fading in and out of LED 1 and 2 simultaneously keeping them at opposite brightnesses.

```cpp
const int led1 = 3;
const int led2 = 5;

void setup() {
  pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
    analogWrite(led1, brightness);
    analogWrite(led2, 255 - brightness);
    delay(10);
  }
  for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
    analogWrite(led1, brightness);
    analogWrite(led2, 255 - brightness);
    delay(10);
  }
}
```
