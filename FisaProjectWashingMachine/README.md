# Washing Machine Tinkercad Simulation

This repository contains the Tinkercad simulation for a solar-powered washing machine controller, designed according to the requirements in the [FisaProjectInstructions](https://github.com/230500226/ESS370S/blob/main/FisaProject/FisaProjectInstructions.md). The simulation emulates the core components of a washing machine using Arduino-compatible hardware available in Tinkercad, including the drum motor, water pump, inlet valve, water level sensor, start/pause button, and infrared communications.

## Project Brief

The washing machine project demonstrates energy-efficient control and operation, with the aim to save the user money by interacting responsibly with a solar energy system. The controller manages the washing cycles, water filling and draining, and drum rotation, all while monitoring simulated water levels and available power. Key features include:

- **Drum Motor Simulation:** Four green LEDs represent the drum motor, showing direction and speed.
- **Water Pump & Valve:** A pump is emulated via a Tinkercad component, with a blue LED acting as the inlet valve indicator.
- **Water Level Monitoring:** A potentiometer simulates the water level sensor.
- **User Control:** A push button starts or pauses the washing cycle.
- **Infrared Power Check:** Code includes a function to simulate power availability checks.
- **Display:** Serial output displays the current cycle for user feedback.

All pin assignments and functional requirements follow the detailed instructions in the project brief.

## Repository Structure

A **separate repository** was created for this simulation project to optimally manage all versions of the code using branches. This approach allows for clear organization of the base version, feature enhancements, and bugfix iterations, ensuring the project stays well-organized and maintainable as development progresses.
