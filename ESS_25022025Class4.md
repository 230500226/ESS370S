The `millis()` function in Arduino returns the number of milliseconds that have passed since the Arduino board began running the current program. This function is useful for timing events and creating non-blocking delays in your code. Here's an example of how you might use it:

```cpp
unsigned long previousMillis = 0;
const long interval = 1000; // interval at which to blink (milliseconds)

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();

  if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval) {
    previousMillis = currentMillis;
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, !digitalRead(LED_BUILTIN));
  }
}
```

In this example, the LED will toggle its state every second.
