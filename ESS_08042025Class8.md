1. Test memo

The HE-SR04 and the 28015 REV C are both ultrasonic distance sensors, but they have some differences in their specifications and usage.

### HE-SR04:
1. **Operating Voltage**: 5V
2. **Working Current**: 15mA
3. **Measuring Range**: 2cm - 400cm
4. **Measuring Angle**: 15 degrees
5. **Trigger Input Signal**: 10µS TTL pulse
6. **Echo Output Signal**: Input TTL lever signal and the range in proportion
7. **Accuracy**: Up to 3mm

### 28015 REV C:
1. **Operating Voltage**: 3.3V - 5V
2. **Working Current**: 2mA
3. **Measuring Range**: 3cm - 400cm
4. **Measuring Angle**: 30 degrees
5. **Trigger Input Signal**: 10µS TTL pulse
6. **Echo Output Signal**: Analog voltage proportional to distance
7. **Accuracy**: Up to 1cm

### Key Differences:
- **Operating Voltage**: The HE-SR04 operates at 5V, whereas the 28015 REV C can operate between 3.3V and 5V.
- **Working Current**: The 28015 REV C has a lower working current (2mA) compared to the HE-SR04 (15mA).
- **Measuring Angle**: The HE-SR04 has a narrower measuring angle (15 degrees) compared to the 28015 REV C (30 degrees).
- **Output Signal**: The HE-SR04 provides a digital output, while the 28015 REV C provides an analog output proportional to the distance.
- **Accuracy**: The HE-SR04 has a higher accuracy (up to 3mm) compared to the 28015 REV C (up to 1cm).

These differences can influence the choice of sensor based on the specific requirements of your project, such as power consumption, measurement range, and signal processing capabilities.

Exercise 1
``` c++
const int buttonPin = 2;    // Pin where the button is connected
const int ledPin = 13;      // Pin where the LED is connected

unsigned long startTime;
unsigned long endTime;
unsigned long duration;
bool buttonPressed = false;

void setup() {
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  startTime = millis();  // Record the start time
}

void loop() {
  // Check if the button has been pressed
  if (digitalRead(buttonPin) == HIGH && !buttonPressed) {
    endTime = millis();  // Record the end time
    duration = endTime - startTime;  // Calculate the duration
    buttonPressed = true;
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);  // Turn on the LED

    // Keep the LED on for the duration
    delay(duration);
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // Turn off the LED
  }
}
```
