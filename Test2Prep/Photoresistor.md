Certainly! Here is an explanation for using a photoresistor (also known as an LDR – Light Dependent Resistor) in a format similar to your MotorDriver.md file:

# Photoresistor (LDR) – Light Sensor

#### Demo for reading light levels with a photoresistor – TODO

## 1. What is a Photoresistor?

A photoresistor, or LDR, is a component whose resistance decreases as the ambient light increases. It’s commonly used for light sensing in embedded systems.

## 2. Pinout & Basic Circuit

- **LDR:** Two leads; not polarized.
- **Typical Circuit:**
  - Connect one lead of the LDR to 5V.
  - Connect the other lead to both a resistor (e.g., 10kΩ) to GND and to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on your microcontroller.
  - The analog input reads the voltage divider value.

**Wiring Diagram:**

```plaintext
   5V ---- LDR ----+---- Analog Pin (A0)
                   |
                 10kΩ
                   |
                  GND
```

## 3. How it Works

- The LDR and resistor form a voltage divider.
- As light increases, the LDR’s resistance drops, causing the voltage at the analog pin to rise.
- The analog input reads a higher value in brighter light, and a lower value in darkness.

---

## 4. Example Code Snippet (Arduino/C++)

```cpp
#define LDR_PIN A0  // Analog pin connected to the voltage divider

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);    // For debugging
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(LDR_PIN);  // Reads value (0–1023)
  Serial.print("Light Level: ");
  Serial.println(sensorValue);

  delay(500);  // Read every half second
}
```

- `analogRead(LDR_PIN)` returns an integer from 0 (dark) to 1023 (bright).
- You can use the value to trigger actions (e.g., turn on a light when dark).

## 5. Logic Table (Example Usage)

| Light Level | LDR Value (approx) | Action           |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Bright      | 800–1023           | Turn OFF LED     |
| Dim         | 400–800            | Idle             |
| Dark        | 0–400              | Turn ON LED      |

## 6. Summary Table

| Step                | What Happens                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1. LDR senses light | Changes resistance                  |
| 2. AnalogRead       | Gets voltage divider output         |
| 3. Microcontroller  | Converts to digital value (0–1023)  |
| 4. Use in code      | Take action based on light level    |

---

## 7. Variations

- Change the resistor value to adjust sensitivity.
- Use in outdoor/indoor light sensors, automatic night lights, etc.
- For more precise control, calibrate thresholds in your code.
